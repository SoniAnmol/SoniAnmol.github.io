I got idea of writing this brief article from a LinkedIn post shared by my
senior [Julivius Prawira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/julivius-prawira/) so a huge shout out to him! Apart from the
resources listed below, I strongly recommend reading [The Productivity Project](https://alifeofproductivity.com/the-productivity-project/)
by Chris Bailey, suggested to me by another senior cum
mentor [Mikhail Sirenko.](https://twitter.com/mikhailsirenko)
I am a productivity nerd and this book equipped me with all the strategies for surviving the thesis life and
making the most out of it. With that said, following are the five tools I am using for my thesis project.

### 1. Responding to reviewer comments

[The Drafts Review Matrix](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/06/how-to-respond-to-reviewer-comments-the-drafts-review-matrix/)

Above linked article is a brief read on how to effectively manage the comments and remarks from supervisors. It is very
useful in case you have multiple parties/supervisors involved in your thesis project. I use Google Sheets for creating
the matrix explained in
the [article by Raul Pacheco](http://www.raulpacheco.org/2016/06/how-to-respond-to-reviewer-comments-the-drafts-review-matrix/)
. Feel free
to [copy the template from here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ukUPQpvkhxYImxW5ozEyU843F3oTEzhjfGca0lm5AsE/edit?usp=sharing)

### 2. Overcoming the writer's block

[The Most Dangerous Writing App](https://maebert.github.io/themostdangerouswritingapp/#/)

Struggling with the writer's block? Give this app a try and it will force your fingers to dance on the keyboard. Personally, I am
not using it much as I have divided my day into blocks. I have designated mornings hours for writing when my creative juices
are at its peak.

### 3. Structuring your thesis

[Storyboarding the research](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/storyboarding-research/)

I am a visual learner therefore it's easier for me to use a storyboard for getting a helicopter view of the bigger
picture.
This [article]([https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/storyboarding-research/](https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/writingforresearch/2017/07/17/storyboarding-research/))
explains the entire storyboarding procedure in detail. There are multiple tools and digital whiteboards available
online. This process helps me immensely to structure the sections and document. I personally
use [Miro](https://www.miro.com) because of
its [integration with the MS-Teams environment.]([https://miro.com/marketplace/microsoft-teams/](https://miro.com/marketplace/microsoft-teams/))
I use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) for creating flowcharts and UML diagrams however I don't find it useful as a
virtual whiteboard.

### 4. Reference management

[Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbit.com/) + [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)

Managing references and citations is something that I hate the most. Therefore, I use
old trusted [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) for automating the management of references and citations.
[Zotero](www.zotero.org) connects seamlessly with [Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbit.com/), Google Docs, Microsoft
Word and Overleaf, etc.
[Research Rabbit](https://researchrabbit.com/) is another very useful tool for managing research papers and its forward and
backwards snowballing is very handy. In addition to this, you can generate beautiful paper networks for including in
your literature review.

> Honourable mention for reference management: [Endnote](https://www.endnote.com/en/)
> 
> Honourable mention for snowballing: [Connected papers](https://www.connectedpapers.com/)
> 
> Wondering why to do all this in first place? Read this article on the use
of [reference managers.](https://subjectguides.york.ac.uk/reference-management#:~:text=Reference%20management%20software%20helps%20you,and%20improves%20consistency%20and%20accuracy.)

### 5. Project management and scheduling

[Projectlibre](https://projectlibre.org/)

[Projectlibre](https://projectlibre.org/) is a free and open-source alternative of [Microsoft Projects](). I discovered
this tool through ["Alternative to"](https://www.alternativeto.net/) a website dedicated to finding alternate crowd sourced software. I
used [projectlibre](https://projectlibre.org/) for planning the timeline of my thesis and am currently using it
for tracking my progress.



These are the tools I am currently using. I will update this list once I am done with my thesis. Meanwhile, all the best
for your thesis and tell me about what you are doing to make your thesis life easier.
