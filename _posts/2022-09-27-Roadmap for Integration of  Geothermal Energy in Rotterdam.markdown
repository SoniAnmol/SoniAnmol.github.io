# Roadmap for Integration of Geo-Thermal Energy in Rotterdam

<br>

This project was a part of a Joint Interdisciplinary Project organized by TU Delft in the academic year 2021-22. The
course brought students from different academic backgrounds together to solve real-world problems. I teamed up with
Jeroen Emmerik and Angela Klein, who are studying M.Sc. Multi-Machine Engineering and M.Sc. Water Management at TU
Delft, respectively. Our team was interdisciplinary and intercultural, making this experience even more rewarding. We
worked with Gemeente Rotterdam (Municipality of Rotterdam) to create a roadmap for integrating geo-thermal energy into
future urban development projects planned in the Waalhaven area of Rotterdam, Netherlands.

<br>

Waalhaven is part of the old harbor area that is proposed to be converted into a residential area to tackle the housing
crisis in the region. This area is also rich in geothermal resources that can be used for residential heating, reducing
dependency on gas import. However, there is still a lot of misinformation around geothermal energy, leading to negative
public perception. Additionally, identifying the technology, capacity, scale, and location required for the plant is
quite challenging at a later stage of urban development. Therefore, to optimize the potential of geothermal energy, its
application should be integrated with urban planning. This project tackled all the aforementioned challenges by creating
a roadmap for integrating geothermal energy into urban planning.

<br>

The project deliverables communicated geothermal potential, possible technologies, and space requirements with urban
planners to support the consideration of geothermal application during urban planning. Additionally, this report
proposed a framework for involving local citizens in the project to improve social acceptance of geothermal energy.

<br>

My contribution to this project was an actor network scan and preparing a social engagement strategy. I also contributed
to the estimation of heating demand for the planned neighborhood.

The salient features of this project are showcased in the following poster. If you have any questions or want to know
