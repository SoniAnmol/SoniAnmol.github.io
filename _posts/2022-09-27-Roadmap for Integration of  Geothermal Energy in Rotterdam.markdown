# Roadmap for Integration of Geo-Thermal Energy in Rotterdam

<br>

This project was part of Joint Interdisciplinary Project organised by TU Delft in the academic year 2021-22. 
This course brings students from different academic backgrounds together to solve a real world problem.
I teamed up with Jeroen Emmerik and Angela Klein studying M.Sc. Multi-Machine Engineering and M.Sc. Water Management at
TU Delft respectively.
Apart from being interdisciplinary, our team was also intercultural which made this experience even more rewarding.
We worked together with Gemeente Rotterdam (Municipality of Rotterdam) to create a roadmap for integrating geo-thermal
energy in the future urban development projects planned in the Waalhaven area of Rotterdam, Netherlands.

<br>

Waalhaven is part of the old harbour area which is proposed to be converted into a residential area for tackling the
housing crisis in the region.
This area is also rich in geo-thermal resources that can be used for residential heating and reducing the
dependency on gas import.
However, there is still a lot of misinformation around geo-thermal energy which leads to negative public perception.
Additionally, identifying the technology, capacity, scale and location required for the plant is quite challenging at a
later stage of urban development.
Therefore, to optimise the potential of geo-thermal energy, its application should be integrated with the urban planning.
This project tackled all the aforementioned challenges by creating a road map for integrating geo-thermal energy in the
urban planning.

<br>

The project deliverables communicated geothermal potential, possible technologies, and space requirements with urban 
planners to support consideration of geo-thermal application during urban planning. Additionally, this report also
proposed a framework for involving local citizens in the project for improving social acceptance of geothermal energy.

<br>

My contribution in this project was actor network scan and preparing social engagement strategy. I also contributed in 
the evaluation of heating demand of the planned neighbourhood.

<br>

Salient features of this project are showcased in the following poster.
