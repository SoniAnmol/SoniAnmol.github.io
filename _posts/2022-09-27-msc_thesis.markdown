# Agent-Based Model Analysis of Demand Response in Energy Communities

<br>

With the exponential increase in distributed renewable energy, optimizing local electricity consumption and generation
is necessary to avoid congestion and over-stressing in the distribution network. Recent literature suggests that energy
communities, along with smart grid applications, can effectively optimize local consumption and generation of
electricity and stabilize the distribution network.

<br>

Energy communities are bottom-up citizen-driven initiatives involved in generating and consuming electricity from
renewable sources (e.g., solar PV, wind farms). Traditionally, these communities consist only of residential members who
use electricity mostly in the morning and evening. Meanwhile, non-residential community members (such as schools, office
buildings, etc.) located in the neighborhood use electricity mostly during work hours. Thus, this complementary
electricity consumption profile by residential and non-residential buildings can be utilized through demand response.
Demand response is an incentive-based policy instrument that rewards consumers for regulating their electricity
consumption based on availability and pricing. Demand response not only stabilizes the local distribution network but
also is a step toward an inclusive, affordable, and sustainable energy system.

<br>

An agent-based model is developed to evaluate the effect of demand response on the self-sufficiency and expenditure on
electricity import for the modeled energy community. This model allows the user to model an energy community (including
both residential and non-residential members) and perform experiments to analyze the performance of a community using
demand response. This model can help decision-makers in preparing an energy plan for the community.
