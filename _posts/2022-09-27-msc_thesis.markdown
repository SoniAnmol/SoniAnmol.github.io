# Exploring demand response in Dutch Energy Communities

<br>

With an exponential increase in distributed renewable energy, optimisation of local electricity consumption and
generation is required to avoid congestion and over-stressing in the distribution network. Recent literature suggests
that Energy Communities along with smart-grid applications can effectively optimise local consumption and generation of
electricity and stabilise the distribution network.

<br>

Energy communities are bottoms-up citizen-driven initiatives involved in generating and consuming electricity from
renewable sources (e.g. Solar PV, Wind farms). Traditionally these communities constitute only residential members using
electricity mostly in the morning and evening. Whereas, non-residential community members (such as schools, office
buildings, etc.) located in the neighbourhood use electricity mostly during the work hours. Thus, this complementary
electricity consumption profile by residential and non-residential buildings can be utilised through demand response.
Demand response is an incentive-based policy instrument that rewards consumers for regulating their electricity
consumption based on the availability and pricing. Thus, demand response not only stabilises the local distribution
network but also is a step toward an inclusive, affordable and sustainable energy system.

<br>

An agent-based model is developed for evaluating the effect of demand response on the self-sufficiency and
expenditure on electricity import for the modeled energy community.
This model allows the user to model an energy community (including both residential and non-residential members) and
perform experiments to analyse the performance of a community using demand response. This model can help decision makers
in preparing energy plan for the community.
