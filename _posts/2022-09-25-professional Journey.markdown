# Professional Journey

This is a short summary of my professional journey till now. If you have any questions or want to know more, please feel
to [contact me](mailto:anmol_soni@outlook.com)

<br>

### Designing Solar PV Systems for Rural Electrification

As a Mechanical Engineering graduate with a Post Graduation Diploma in Power Plant Engineering, I began my professional
journey in India by joining Boond, a social enterprise working for rural electrification. With a successful track record
of electrifying over 300 households in 27 remote hamlets, I progressed to designing grid-scale solar PV systems at
Vibgyour Energy in New Delhi, India. This role provided me with hands-on experience in designing and managing grid-scale
projects.

### Career Transition to Energy Policy

Driven by a desire to create a positive impact at the grassroots level, I transitioned to energy policy by joining Bask
Research Foundation as a Research Associate. In this capacity, I worked on capacity building of electricity consumers in
Rajasthan, India, and participated actively in regulatory matters related to electricity distribution in the region.
This experience included extensive travel to remote and serene villages of Rajasthan, which enriched both my career and
personal growth.

During this period, I also focused on enhancing my analytical and policy analysis skills by taking
courses on Data analysis with Python and Energy economy and policy offered by IIT Madras, attending i-policy for Young
Leaders, a crash course organised by the Centre for Civil Society, and attending the workshop on Energy efficiency in
emerging economies by the International Energy Agency. These programs not only helped me understand the fundamentals of
energy efficiency but also connected me with young aspiring leaders working for energy transition at the policy front.

### Moving to The Netherlands

In 2020, I moved to the Netherlands to pursue a master's degree in policy analysis using data-driven tools and
simulation at TU Delft. As a part of the Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA) program, I worked on multiple
interdisciplinary real-world problems. To make the most of my master's experience, I am following the Honours Programme
Master (HPM) track of my program, with a focus on the modelling and simulation track of EPA. Consequently, I joined the
HERoS-EU project as a Research Assistant and contributed to building an agent-based model of the Hague to simulate the
spread of infection in the city.

<br>

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been an active member of various student associations. During my first year
of the master's program, I served as a board member of Dentatus, the study association of EPA. In my second year, I
served as TPM faculty ambassador for Delft Global Student Club, an initiative for promoting research and sustainability
projects in the global south. I also took on an editorial role for publishing the first edition of Delft Global Student
Club magazine.

### PhD Journey

Upon completing my master's degree, I was determined to pursue a career that would allow me to tackle global challenges
at the intersection of technology, policy, and society. This led me to discover a unique opportunity to work as a
doctoral candidate at Maastricht University, in 2023, where I was drawn to both the research topic and the beauty of the
city.

<br>

My doctoral research focuses on the intricate interplay between climate policies, public sentiment, and macroeconomic
firm behavior. To analyze the complex relationships between these factors, I plan to employ a range of mixed research
methods, including social media analysis and agent-based modeling. Through my research, I strive to provide data-driven
insights that can support effective policymaking in addressing the
urgent challenge of climate change.
