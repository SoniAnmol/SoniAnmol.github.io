### Improving Plastic Circularity in Dutch Automotive Industry through Agent-Based Modelling 

<br>

This project was conducted as part of the Advanced Agent Based Modelling course at TU Delft during the second quarter of
the 2021/22 academic year. The project was carried out in collaboration with RIVM (National Institute for Public Health
and the Environment), with the aim of improving the circularity of plastic in the Dutch automotive industry. To achieve
this goal, RIVM conducted stakeholder interviews and focused discussions to identify key barriers, opportunities, and
policy solutions. Based on these findings, RIVM formulated a set of policies and sought to evaluate their effectiveness.

<br>

Our group developed an agent-based model to virtually test the effectiveness of these policies. The model is highly
modular and can be accessed via the provided [link](https://github.com/max-reddel/QONNECT). If you are interested in learning more about this project, please
