# Q-connect

<br>

This project was a deliverable for the course Advanced Agent Based Modelling (2021/22 Q2) at TU Delft in collaboration
with RIVM (National Institute for Public Health and the Environment).
RIVM wanted to improve the circularity of plastic in Dutch automotive industry.
For this purpose, they conducted stakeholder interviews and focused discussions for identifying the key barriers,
opportunities, and policy solutions.
RIVM formulated a set of policies and wanted to evaluate the effectiveness of these policies.
Our group developed an agent-based model for virtually testing policy effectiveness. The model is very modular and
can be accessed through this [link](https://github.com/max-reddel/QONNECT).
