# About EPA
Masters Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA) is a unique interdisciplinary program combining society and technology for preparing future leaders to address the [grand challenges]().
This program focused on using data driven methods to solve complex (read [wicked]()) societal problems.
Most of the courses are case study based pedagogy and I provided me with opportunity to work with a number of projects ranging from spread of infections, performing vulnerability and criticality analysis on road networks, to building a behavioral model for emergency response.
