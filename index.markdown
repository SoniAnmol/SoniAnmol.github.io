> Social Data Scientist - Tackling Complex Wicked Problems 

## <span style="color:skyblue">**WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL WEBSITE**</span>

I am an aspiring social data scientist currently pursuing
my [M.Sc in Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis)
from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I write here about my ongoing projects, recent learnings and everything else.

I am currently working on my master's thesis project and looking forward to the job opportunities in the Netherlands. I
am interested in working with an organisation working towards a sustainable future using data-driven tools. Check
my [CV](_pages/cv.md)
and [projects](_pages/my_projects.md) to read more about my work. If you are interested, lets connect

## <span style="color:black">**AREA OF INTEREST**</span>

I am fascinated by the challenges at the intersection of society and technology.
Particularly energy transition, governance, circularity, climate change and social welfare projects.
My choice of tools/methodologies for addressing these challenges are

* Policy Analysis for multi-actor policy perspectives
* Actor strategy modelling and stakeholder management
* Modelling, data analysis and data visualisation.
  * Modelling complex-wicked problems through (multi) agent-based modelling
  * Systems thinking and system dynamics models
  * Modelling simulation for decision-making under (deep) uncertainty
