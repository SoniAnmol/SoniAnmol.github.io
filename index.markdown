> Social Data Scientist - Tackling Complex-Wicked Problems - Data Analysis, Visualisation and Modelling

**Welcome to my personal website.**

I am a social data scientist currently pursing
my [M.Sc in Engineering and Policy Analysis](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis)
from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I write here about my ongoing projects, recent learnings and life. :smile:

## Hire Me
I am currently working on my thesis project and looking forward to starting a new job. I am interested in working with
an organisation working towards a sustainable future using data driven tools. Check my [CV](_pages/cv.md)
and [projects](_pages/my_projects.md) to read more about my work. If you are interested in hiring me, please contact me
via [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/a-soni/) or [email](anmol_sonni@outlook.com).

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the topics at the intersection of society and technology. The broad topics include: Energy
transition, electricity governance, crisis governance, circularity, climate change and social welfare projects.

My choice of tools/methodologies for addressing these global grand challenges are

* Policy Analysis for multi-actor, multi-stakeholder, multi-policy perspectives
* Actor strategy modelling and stakeholder management
* Data analysis and data visualisation.
* Modelling complex-wicked problems
    * through (multi) agent based modeling
    * systems thinking and system dynamics models
    * Modelling simulation for decision-making under (deep) uncertainty
