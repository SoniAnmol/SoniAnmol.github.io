> Social Data Scientist - Tackling Complex Wicked Problems 

## <span style="color:orange">**WELCOME TO MY PERSONAL WEBSITE**</span>

I am a social data scientist currently pursing
my [M.Sc in Engineering and Policy Analysis (EPA)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis)
from [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/). I write here about my ongoing projects, recent learnings and life.

## <span style="color:orange">**RESEARCH INTERESTS**</span>

My research interests lie in the topics at the intersection of society and technology. The broad topics include: Energy
transition, electricity governance, crisis governance, circularity, climate change and social welfare projects.

My choice of tools/methodologies for addressing these global grand challenges are

* Policy Analysis for multi-actor, multi-stakeholder, multi-policy perspectives
* Actor strategy modelling and stakeholder management
* Data analysis and data visualisation.
* Modelling complex-wicked problems
    * through (multi) agent based modeling
    * systems thinking and system dynamics models
    * Modelling simulation for decision-making under (deep) uncertainty
