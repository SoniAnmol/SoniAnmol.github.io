I am an international student from India studying Engineering and Policy
Analysis [(EPA)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis)
at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands.

#### Designing solar PV systems for rural electrification

I started my professional journey in India after my studies
in [B.E. in Mechanical Engineering](https://ghrietn.raisoni.net/ug-mechanical-engineering) and completing my Post
Graduation Diploma in [Power Plant Engineering](https://npti.gov.in/npti_neyveli/home). I started my career
with [Boond](http://boond.net/), a social enterprise working towards rural electrification in India. After electrifying
over 300 households in 27 remote hamlets, I moved on to designing grid scale solar PV systems
at [Vibgyour Energy](https://vibgyorenergy.com/) in New Delhi, India.

#### Career transition to Energy Policy

For creating impact at grassroots level, I made a career transitioned to energy policy by
joining [Bask Research Foundation](https://baskfoundation.org/) as Research Associate.
Working with [Bask](https://baskfoundation.org/) opened up the world of electricity governance for me.
As a Research associate, I primarily worked on capacity building of electricity consumers in Rajasthan, India. In
addition to this, I actively participated in the regulatory matters related to electricity distribution in Rajasthan,
India. I travelled alot and this experience was enriched both my career life and my soul.

During this period, I further improved my understanding of public policy by
attending [i-policy for Young Leaders](https://ccs.in/ipolicy-young-leaders) a crash course organised
by [Centre for civil society](https://ccs.in/). In addition to this, I got opportunity to attend a
workshop [Energy efficiency in emerging economies](https://www.iea.org/programmes/energy-efficiency-in-emerging-economies)
by [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/). This program not only helped me understand the fundamentals of
energy efficiency, but also helped me connect with young aspiring leaders working for energy transition at the policy
front.

#### Moving to the Netherlands

I moved to the Netherlands in 2020 to learn the craft of policy analysis using state-of-the-art technological tools at
TU Delft.
