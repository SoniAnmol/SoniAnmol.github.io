I am an international student from India studying Engineering and Policy
Analysis [(EPA)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis)
at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands. Following is my elaborate professional journey.

### Designing solar PV systems for rural electrification

I started my professional journey in India after completing
my [B.E. in Mechanical Engineering](https://ghrietn.raisoni.net/ug-mechanical-engineering) and Post Graduation Diploma
in [Power Plant Engineering](https://npti.gov.in/npti_neyveli/home). I started my career with [Boond](http://boond.net/)
, a social enterprise working for rural electrification in India. After electrifying over 300 households in 27 remote
hamlets, I transitioned to designing grid-scale solar PV systems at [Vibgyour Energy](https://vibgyorenergy.com/) in New
Delhi, India. This job provided me with hands-on experience in designing and managing grid-scale projects.

### Career transition to Energy Policy

For creating impact at the grassroots level, I made a career transition to energy policy by
joining [Bask Research Foundation](https://baskfoundation.org/) as Research Associate. Working
with [Bask](https://baskfoundation.org/) opened up the world of electricity governance for me. As a research associate,
I primarily worked on the capacity building of electricity consumers in Rajasthan, India. In addition to this, I
actively participated in the regulatory matters related to electricity distribution in Rajasthan, India. This job
involved a lot of travelling to remote and serene villages of Rajasthan enriching both my career and soul.

During this period I also worked on enhancing my analytical and policy analysis skills. I took courses
on [Data analysis with python](https://nptel.ac.in/noc/Ecertificate/?q=NPTEL19CS59S41500241a0ad9d911e9bc73479868cce0f2)
and [Energy economy and policy](https://nptel.ac.in/?q=NPTEL19HS42S61500399a0ad9d911e9bc73479868cce0f2) offered
by [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). To improve my understanding of public policy I
attended [i-policy for Young Leaders](https://ccs.in/ipolicy-young-leaders), a crash course organised by
the [Centre for civil society](https://ccs.in/). I also got an opportunity to attend the workshop
on [Energy efficiency in emerging economies](https://www.iea.org/programmes/energy-efficiency-in-emerging-economies) by
[International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/). This program not only helped me understand the fundamentals of
energy efficiency but also connected me with young aspiring leaders working for energy transition at the policy front.

### Moving to the Netherlands

I moved to the Netherlands in 2020 to master the craft of policy analysis using data-driven tools and simulation
at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/)
. [EPA](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis) (Engineering and
Policy Analysis) allowed me to work on multiple interdisciplinary real-world problems. To get the most out of my
master's experience, I am following the
HPM [(Honours Programme Master)](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/faculteiten/tnw-studentenportal/onderwijs/honours-programme-tnw/hpm-honours-programme-master)
track of my program.

The modelling and simulation track
of [EPA](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis) attracted me the
most. Therefore, I joined the [HERoS-EU project](https://www.heros-project.eu/)  as Research Assistant and helped in building an
agent-based model of the Hague to simulate the spread of infection in the city.

During my first year of master's, I also
served as a board member of [Dentatus](https://dentatus.curius.nl/), the study association
of [EPA](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis). Currently, I am
in my second year and serving as [TPM faculty](https://www.tudelft.nl/tbm) ambassador
of [Delft Global Student Club](https://issuu.com/delftglobalstudentclub/docs/owee_flyer_dgsc_2_), an initiative for
promoting tech-for-good and research in the global south. Currently, I am
helping [Delft Global Student Club](https://issuu.com/delftglobalstudentclub/docs/owee_flyer_dgsc_2_) to publish their
first magazine.
