I am an international student from India studying Engineering and Policy
Analysis [(EPA)](https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/epa/msc-engineering-and-policy-analysis)
at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/) in the Netherlands.

#### Designing solar PV systems for rural electrification

I started my professional journey in India after completing
my [B.E. in Mechanical Engineering](https://ghrietn.raisoni.net/ug-mechanical-engineering) and Post
Graduation Diploma in [Power Plant Engineering](https://npti.gov.in/npti_neyveli/home). I started my career
with [Boond](http://boond.net/), a social enterprise working for rural electrification in India. After electrifying
over 300 households in 27 remote hamlets, I moved to designing grid scale solar PV systems
at [Vibgyour Energy](https://vibgyorenergy.com/) in New Delhi, India.

#### Career transition to Energy Policy

For creating impact at grassroots level, I made a career transitioned to energy policy by
joining [Bask Research Foundation](https://baskfoundation.org/) as Research Associate.
Working with [Bask](https://baskfoundation.org/) opened up the world of electricity governance for me.
As a Research associate, I primarily worked on capacity building of electricity consumers in Rajasthan, India. In
addition to this, I actively participated in the regulatory matters related to electricity distribution in Rajasthan,
India. This job involved a lot of travelling to remote and serene villages of Rajasthan enriching both my career and soul.

During this period I also worked on enhancing my analytical and policy analysis skills. I took courses
on [Data analysis with python](https://nptel.ac.in/noc/Ecertificate/?q=NPTEL19CS59S41500241a0ad9d911e9bc73479868cce0f2)
and [Energy economy and policy](https://nptel.ac.in/?q=NPTEL19HS42S61500399a0ad9d911e9bc73479868cce0f2) offered
by [IIT Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/). To improve my understanding of public policy I
attended [i-policy for Young Leaders](https://ccs.in/ipolicy-young-leaders) a crash course organised
by [Centre for civil society](https://ccs.in/). I also got an opportunity to attend the workshop
on [Energy efficiency in emerging economies](https://www.iea.org/programmes/energy-efficiency-in-emerging-economies)
by [International Energy Agency](https://www.iea.org/). This program not only helped me understand the fundamentals of
energy efficiency, but also connected me with young aspiring leaders working for energy transition at the policy
front.

#### Moving to the Netherlands

I moved to the Netherlands in 2020 to learn the craft of policy analysis using state-of-the-art technological tools at
[TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/).
