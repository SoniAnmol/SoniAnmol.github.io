I am an international student from India studying Engineering and Policy Analysis at TU Delft. I started my professional
career designing Solar PV plants in India and later transitioned to energy policy and regulatory governance. Working in
the policy sector enticed me to learn more about it. Therefore, I moved to the Netherlands in 2020 to learn the craft of policy
analysis using state-of-the-art technological tools at TU Delft.
